CernLib is an application built for those who are either struggling with learning how to develop and consume RESTFul API's using nodejs in their android application.


I decided to create this application because I found out that there are very little resources on how to create and consume nodejs API's in Android application.
</p>

<h2>How can I use this application?</h2>
<p>You can either fork or clone this repository and then you install the necessary tools that will enable you run this application. 
The necessary tools are:
1. <strong>Android Studio</strong>
2. <strong>Nodejs</strong>
3. <strong>Mongodb</strong>
</p>
<h2>Server Part</h2>
<p>
Once you have them installed, open up your command terminal, navigate to your desired location in your computer and clone this repository (if you want to clone it). Then enter "npm install" to install all the necessary node modules. After which you enter "npm start" to run your server.
But you also need to run mongo and mongod on different instances of the command terminal.
</p>
<h3>Android App Part</h3>
<p>
On the android application part, open up the android project with your Android Studio, open the "URLs" file, change the IP address present on the URLs to your computer's IP address. To get your computer's IP address open up your command terminal and enter ipconfig.
Then install your android app on your phone and make sure that you connect your computer to your phone's hotspot (i.e your mobile phone must share the same WiFi network with your computer). Then open up the app, login and enjoy!.
